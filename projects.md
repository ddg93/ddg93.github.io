# Projects

Here's an overview of my Research and Personal projects.

## A Deep Learning approach to measure particles suspended in fluid flows

[A Deep Learning approach to measure particles suspended in fluid flows.](/projects/le_ring)

## A Scalable GPU Solver for Fibre-Laden Turbulent Flows

[A first GPU-accelerated, MPI-parallelised solver for fibre-laden turbulent flows, featuring a novel communication algorithm for simulating long and flexible fibres on super-computers.](/projects/hpc/)
