# Projects

Here's an overview of my Research and Personal projects.

## Project 1
Convolutional Neural Networks to measure particle orientations in fluid flows with a dual-camera setup.

## Project 2
Porting of a turbulent channel flow solver to CUDA for GPU-accellerated simulations on Europe's largest super-computers.
