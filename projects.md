# Projects

Here's an overview of my Research and Personal projects.

## Project 1

Convolutional Neural Networks to measure particle orientations in fluid flows with a dual-camera setup.

## Scalable GPU Solver for Fibre-Laden Turbulent Flows

[Developed the first GPU-accelerated, MPI-parallelised solver for fibre-laden turbulent flows, featuring a novel communication algorithm for simulating long and flexible fibres on super-computers.](/projects/hpc/)
